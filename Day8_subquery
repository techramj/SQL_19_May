Rule:
1. subquery should be written in bracket().
2. use single row operator for single row subquery and multiple row operator for multiple row subquery
3. use subquery on the right side 
4. order by clause is not allowed in subquery except top-N query.






Single row operator:
>
>=
<
<=
=
!= <>
is
between and

Mutiple row operator
IN
any
